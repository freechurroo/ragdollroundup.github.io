		<p class="siteinfo"> Ragdoll roundup was created in 2023 for a college students project, but the site struck a cord with ragdoll lovers.</p>
		</dev>
		<div>
		<p class="siteinfop"> Ragdoll roundup has been a website for a short period now, gathering all ragdoll lovers and owners to share the cutest pictures of their babies. We encourage a loving and safe platform to find other enthusiasts and friends. With all the cuddly love you can find, Ragdoll Roundup welcomes anyone onto our cute little site! </p>
			<p class="siteinfop"> On this site, you can share pictures of your babies and look at all the pictures of other fluffy cats that you want! We even partner with breeders so others seeking their first ragdoll or another addition to their clouds can easily find great places to get kittens. Our breeders are required to be TICA certified and need to have at least a 4 star average review. </p>
			<p class="siteinfop"> We also do meet ups for site members 18 and older. Currently, we only do these meetups in the United States. Giveaways and games are usually hosted at these meetups. </p>
